<ol>
	<li>Add 1 inch of water to a sauce pot, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
	<li>Once boiling, add an egg (or however many you'd like as long as they are in a single layer in the bottom of the pot), straight from the refrigerator into the pot. Replace the lid and let it continue to boil for exactly six minutes.</li>
	<li>After six minutes, remove the egg(s) from the pot and place them in an ice water bath or run under cool water until they are cool enough to handle. Peel, and enjoy!</li>

	<p>Why is this one of my favorite recipes?<br>Soft boiled eggs can be used in many different ways, for one it can be thrown in with your cup noodles and maybe add that flavor its missing, if you have not tried it, I highly suggest it.You can also try it with some Avocado Toast, it is also very versatile, you can make it as soft or not and adjust it to your liking! Even eating it with just some salt is good too, but I do like eating it with other dishes.</p>
