			<h2>I love to travel!</h2>
			<p>I like to try and travel whenever I can, have not been to as much places as I'd like to say.
			My favorite place to visit would have to be New York, definitely would like to go somewhere in the west coast one of these days, or possibly even out the country!</p>
