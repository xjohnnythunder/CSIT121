	<h1>Meaningful Images To Me</h1>
	<p>
		My first sport that meant a lot to me is Skateboarding. To me it's a form of art and passion, and I used it to express myself a lot back then, I will forever love the sport!

		Another sport that I really like to play is Basketball. When I am not skateboarding you can most likely catch me playing ball, It's very fun and takes skill!

		In my downtime I like to relax and play some video games, although I haven't played them much lately, I find it very relaxing.

		I'm a drinker, and no not alcohol, a bubble tea drinker.
