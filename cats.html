			<h2>I have 2 cats!</h2>
			<p>I'd like to introduce my 2 cats to you guys! The white and black cat is named Sora, and the orange is one is named Stormy. I was never usually a cat person, but after getting them both, I am a changed man! The stereotype that cats are not as clingy or is not as frinedly as dogs are lies! Complete lies! These 2 are the friendliest cats I've ever seen, although the orange one does have her feisty moments, but I think it's just her personality, maybe.</p>
